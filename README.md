# Data Science of Amaranth Seeds

Amaranth (莧菜) is a South American crop originally planted by the Aztecs, and is consumed around the world today. Its leaves are fibrous and filling, the plant itself is a prolific grower in hot and humid climates, and amazingly each plant generates a staggering number of seeds about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. In fact, one plant can produce thousands of potent seeds; in other words, **one plant can seed acres of land.** It is also one of my favorite plants because its leaves are great for soup, its seeds are nutritious and tastes like popcorn, and it's a beautiful purple-pink, unwieldy, lavish mess of a plant to witness in person. In this project, I want to observe the average size of amaranth seeds. I will be using tools of data science like R and basic statistics to supplement my observations.
